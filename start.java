    // While I borrowed some aspects from both, the actual project itself is mine -- hence the bugs and inefficiencies
    // These tutorials are for NORMAL TictacToe (refer to CLASSIC), not the 3-10 players (refer to REMASTERED)

    // I wouldn't say its "copied code", the method of checking win conditions in classic is the same in both videos, it is to manually check each button since its a small board
    // Anyways, I just want to clarify so I dont get a 0 for looking at tutorials when REMASTERED/2.0 is the the actual project. Classic is just there for regular tic tac toe.

    // TLDR; CLASSIC METHODS = borrowed/influenced/learned from tutorials
    // REMASTERED METHODS = scratch

    // Hopefully that clears it up (im just scared to get a 0 for looking at tutorials)
